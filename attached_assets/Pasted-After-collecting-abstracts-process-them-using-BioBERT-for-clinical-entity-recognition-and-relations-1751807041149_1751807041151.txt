After collecting abstracts, process them using BioBERT for clinical entity recognition and relationship extraction. Use the Hugging Face model dmis-lab/biobert-base-cased-v1.1, and perform inference using the transformers and torch libraries.

Key information to extract from each abstract:

Demographic Data: age group, gender, population type (e.g., pediatric, elderly)

Injury/Procedure Characteristics: tendon zone, fracture type, nerve type, anatomical location

Surgical Interventions: grafting, fixation, nerve decompression, occupational therapy, splinting

Clinical Outcomes: grip strength, range of motion (ROM), pain reduction, reoperation rate, return-to-work time, complication rates

Use rule-based enhancement where BioBERT is ambiguous, and assign a confidence score to each abstract based on completeness and clarity of extracted entities. Filter out low-confidence results (e.g., score < 0.3).

ðŸ§± 3. Structured Data Conversion
Map NLP outputs into structured features appropriate for ML modeling:

Age Group: pediatric (0â€“18), adult (19â€“65), elderly (65+)

Zone & Injury Type: e.g., Zone II flexor injury, metacarpal fracture, radial nerve repair

Treatment Types: encoded as binary or ordinal features

Outcomes:

Binary: complication (yes/no), surgical success (yes/no)

Continuous: days to functional recovery, change in grip strength (if extractable)

Normalize and encode variables using one-hot encoding or ordinal scales.

ðŸ“Š 4. Machine Learning Modeling
Train three predictive models using structured data:

Complication Risk (Binary classification)

Return to Function (e.g., work) (Regression)

Surgical Outcome Success (Binary classification)

Use:

Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost for classification tasks

XGBoost Regressor for continuous predictions (e.g., healing time)

Split your dataset (80/20 train/test), and use 5-fold cross-validation for model robustness. Evaluate performance using:

Classification: AUC-ROC, accuracy, F1-score, sensitivity, specificity

Regression: RÂ², RMSE, MAE

ðŸ“ˆ 5. Visualization and Interpretation
Produce:

ROC curves and feature importance plots for each model

Scatter plots for predicted vs. actual healing times

Tables summarizing the top predictive features (e.g., age, zone, procedure type)

Interpret model behavior in the context of clinical knowledge (e.g., Zone II injuries associated with higher reoperation risk).
