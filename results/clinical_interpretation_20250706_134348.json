  "Clinical Task Insights": "**Complication Risk Prediction**: Excellent predictive performance (AUC = 0.980) suggests reliable complication risk assessment. Early identification of high-risk patients can guide preventive interventions and informed consent.\n\n**Surgical Success Prediction**: High accuracy (F1 = 0.875) in predicting surgical outcomes. Preoperative success prediction aids in surgical planning and patient counseling.",
  "Clinical Practice Recommendations": "**Clinical Practice Recommendations:**\n\n1. **Risk Stratification**: Use complication risk models to identify high-risk patients requiring enhanced monitoring and preventive measures.\n\n2. **Patient Counseling**: Leverage outcome predictions to provide patients with evidence-based expectations about recovery times and success rates.\n\n3. **Surgical Planning**: Consider predictive factors when planning surgical approach and postoperative care protocols.\n\n4. **Quality Improvement**: Monitor actual outcomes against predictions to identify areas for clinical process improvement.\n\n5. **Resource Allocation**: Use recovery time predictions for better scheduling and resource planning in rehabilitation services.",
  "Limitations and Considerations": "**Limitations and Considerations:**\n\n1. **Sample Size**: Analysis based on 43249 abstracts. Larger datasets may improve model robustness.\n\n2. **Literature Bias**: Results reflect published literature which may have publication bias toward positive outcomes.\n\n3. **Feature Extraction**: NLP-based feature extraction may miss nuanced clinical details present in full text articles.\n\n4. **Temporal Factors**: Models may not account for evolving surgical techniques and technologies over time.\n\n5. **External Validation**: Models should be validated on independent datasets before clinical implementation.\n\n6. **Clinical Context**: Predictions should complement, not replace, clinical judgment and patient-specific factors."
